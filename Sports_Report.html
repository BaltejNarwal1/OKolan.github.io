     Neymar's recovery from surgery could take up to three months, according to the Brazil team doctor.The 26-year-old Paris Saint-Germain forward has arrived in Rio de Janeiro ahead of an operation on his fractured foot, which will keep him out of the Champions League second-leg tie against Real Madrid.Doctor Rodrigo Lasmar arrived with Neymar and said: "The (recovery) period will be around two and a half to three months." Neymar cracked the fifth metatarsal in his right foot and hurt his ankle during Sunday's 3-0 win over Marseille.The former Barcelona man was stretchered off in tears after he was hurt in a challenge from Bouna Sarr.A subsequent PSG statement read: "After an initial treatment period of three days in line with a strict medical protocol, a joint decision has been taken between the medical staffs of both Paris Saint-Germain and the Brazil national team.

          Italy need me â€“ Buffon confirms international return

        <p>
        Juventus veteran Buffon, 40, announced his international retirement after Italy's failure to qualify for this year's FIFA World Cup in Russia following their shock play-off defeat to Sweden in November.Italy caretaker manager Luigi Di Biagio said he expected the country's record caps-holder Buffon to return next month, when the Azzurri face Argentina in Manchester on March 23 before taking on England at Wembley four days later.And Buffon confirmed his plans to help the national team, who failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1958."I feel a sense of responsibility at this time of transition for our national team," Buffon told 'Tiki Taka' on Italia 1."There will be two important friendly matches, I thought about going on holiday with my family, but if the national team needs me I have to answer that I am ready and I cannot desert."I do this for loyalty and responsibility, without thinking about what my future will be."The players who have experience at the moment could be useful against Argentina and England."Buffon has made 13 Serie A appearances for reigning champions Juve this season and 20 across all competitions.
